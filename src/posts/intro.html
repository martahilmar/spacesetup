    This project is our own house.
    It has been built in a 6 months time-frame of 2017/18 by a little company from Northern Denmark - Fjordbak Byg.
    First stage of the house project started with couple of wishes "sketched" down on the paper.
    We wanted a house that is comfortable, healthy and easy to maintain.
    In terms of design, we wanted it to be full of light, contemporary and fairly minimal.
    And in terms of its footprint on the environment, we wanted an energy efficient and sustainable house.
