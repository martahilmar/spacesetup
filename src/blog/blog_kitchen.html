            <div class="title">Kitchen design: Our Ikea hacked kitchen with beautiful design by Reform</div>
            <p class="frame">Kitchen is for us a place with the hubs of activity, from cooking and entertaining to lounging and innovating, the workspace that is the heart of our home.</p><br>
            <p class="frame">We spent a lot of time researching local kitchen companies. Our main thoughts were: unique design, affordable, with a note of industrial style.</p><br>
            <div class="quoted-text"><p class="center"><quot>&ldquo;</quot><br><i>&ldquo;</i> <span>Extraordinary design at a reasonable price.</span> <i>&bdquo;</i></p></div>
            <p class="frame">The luckiest moment was when we stumbled upon Reform CPH. Reform hacks Ikea's basic closet solutions. Their slogan is: "Extraordinary design at a reasonable price". This was exactly what we were looking for. Reform's concept starts with the basic IKEA elements finished with the architect-designed fronts and counters. The tought behind this idea is: "IKEA is providing good quality products in their price range, which is a stable ground for further innovation". Reform took into the house couple of world famous Danish architects and designers, such as BIG, Henning Larsen Architects, Norm Architects, Sigurd Larsen, Christina Meyer Bengtsson, Cecilie Manz, etc. which have customized IKEA kitchens. Their focus was on designing the fronts and counter-tops, creating an aesthetic and personal style in combination with quality construction, function and timeless design.</p><br>
            <p class="frame">Reform CPH has it's own Basic design, which is inspired by classical design from 60ties. Here IKEA's modules are dressed in a classic Scandinavian minimalism - clean and simple faces with an oak finish. The personal touch each can put in this design is almost unlimited choice of colors.</p><br>

            <p class="frame">BIG has designed kitchen with slim dark composite countertop which complements with their front design. Fronts come with the choice of white or oak. Handles are formed with a loop of black webbing used for car seat belts.</p><br>

            <p class="frame">From Henning Larsen Architects the design combines soft wood and hard metal. Drawer fronts and cabinet doors are available in two designs, one spray-painted white with a metal band painted in the same colour, the other in oak veneer with a band of copper strip. The matching countertop could be made in solid oak.</p><br>

            <p class="frame">Norm Architects designed a kitchen combining smoked oak and patinated bronze. Recommended countertop would be made in fiber concrete, or solid, smoked oak. This design streams towards exclusive kitchen look.</p><br>

            <p class="frame">Newest designs were made by Chris Liljenberg Halstrøm and Christina Meyer Bengtsson, Cecilie Manz. Christina Meyer Bengtsson designed really cheerful kitchen. Her kitchen design comes in four different finishes, which can be used singly or mixed to create colorful and vibrant combinations.</p><br>

            <p class="frame">Our choice of design was SL by Sigurd Larsen. The design is made up of thin layers of aluminum that have been shaped by simply cutting, folding and assembling together. The material presents a clean but raw expression. Surfaces are made so that they can tolerate constant use. The color of our kitchen fronts is anthracite black. We fell for this design due to a very special and unusual choice of material used for the fronts, while the colour was reflecting our exterior cladding. Special folding of aluminum to create handles was actually the pick of design.</p><br>
